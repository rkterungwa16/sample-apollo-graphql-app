# Frontend Task Starter

This is a starter kit of [Entry Task for Frontend - My Todos](https://www.notion.so/skandio/Entry-Task-for-Frontend-My-todos-03152f1121364128a4f698ba7e3b1717).
It contains a Mirage server as a mocking backend for you to complete the task.
The server acts as an in-memory database and a GraphQL server.

The server is placed under `src/libraries/server/`.
Inside `src/main.tsx` and `src/Root.tsx` is a simple example about how to use the server in your project.
`import './libraries/server';` will do the magic.

To spin it up, run `pnpm install` & `pnpm dev` (npm should work as well),
then access `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` in your browser.

To complete the task, you are free to do anything to the code -
including but not limited to copy it, modify it, extend it, or ditch it and write your own mocking server from the ground.
